# Use the new [Grype Orb](https://github.com/khulnasoft-lab/circleci-orb-grype). This orb is deprecated and no longer gets updated vulnerability data. 
# KhulnaSoft CircleCi Orbs [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/khulnasoft-lab/circleci-orbs/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/khulnasoft-lab/circleci-orbs/tree/master)

All orbs are tested with .circleci/config.yaml of this repo. Finished orbs will be published to the public CircleCi orb repository under the khulnasoft namespace.

* Orb testing will be initiated upon pushing to repo
* If orb passes linting & packing it will be published using `@dev:alpha`

After the `@dev:alpha` orb is successfully published, integration tests will be triggered. Once all tests have passed, the dev orb can be promoted to production.

The major, minor, or patch version of the Orb will be published based on tag pushed to the git repository.
  * Push a git tag with the following naming convention (major|minor|patch)-release-vX.X.X
    * The orb will automatically be published w/ major, minor or patch version depending on what was specified in tag (the actual version in tag is just for reference)
    * The version specified at the end of the tag (vX.X.X) holds no bearing on the versioning of the published orb.
    * To View the current version of the orb, use the following command:

      ```
      circleci orb info khulnasoft/khulnasoft-engine
      ```

  * Final testing will be performed when this tag is pushed, the publish to production will happen upon manual job approval within the CircleCi WorkFlows UI.
    * For the khulnasoft-engine orb - the `custom_policy_fail` job should always fail, double check that policy evaluation to ensure custom policy was activated. Then go into the failed workflow and approval publish to prod.
